## Iteration 0 - SESSION START

Requirements: ## Test large spec performance

Profile and optimize for 1000+ behavior specs, parallel execution if applicable

### Acceptance Criteria

## Iteration 0 - CHECKLIST

# Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement requirements

## Iteration 1 - AUDITOR

Perfect! The test compiles and fails as expected. Now let me output the required JSON format:

#A{"s":"tw","t":{"n":"generate_large_spec_via_composition_test","f":"test/factory_test.gleam","b":"Forces pure, composable factory design via CUPID principles"},"c":0.9,"why":"Test forces implementer to confront: (C) composability with list.map/range, (U) single-purpose factory function, (P) pure deterministic behavior generation, (I) idiomatic pipelines and pattern matching, (D) domain language of Behavior/Feature/Spec. Implementer must solve: how to generate 1000 unique, valid, deterministic behaviors without I/O or randomness - requires thoughtful design of naming schemes, path generation, and structural validity. 30-line constraint forces focused solution. Discomfort: 'How do I make this pure AND scalable?'"}|{"s":"rc","c":1.0}
